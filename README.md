# Save-a-Life---WebApp
This is a web-based platform that allows users to search for blood donors and
blood banks based on their location with a map preview. If a user wishes to donate blood, they
can also find a list of nearby blood banks in an embedded map. JWT and bcrypt are used for
secure user authentication, and the application is deployed on AWS using Docker containers.
